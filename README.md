Working with media:
--------------------------------------
When working with media (pictures, videos, and music) on the web, a range of techniques and approaches are needed to guarantee optimal performance and accessibility while also fostering an interesting user experience. 

Key point of working with media in web development:
----------------------------------------
•	Images: Choose the correct image format based on the needs of quality, transparency and animation. (eg. JPEG, PNG, WEBP)
•	Video: Responsive design: use CSS to make a video container responsive so that they adjust to different screen size.
•	Audio: Controls: always provide controls for audio playback to allow users to play, pause and adjust volume.
•	General best practices: regular media test performance and accessibility across different devices and browser to ensure an optimal user experience.

Adding media to web projects improves user interaction and provides dynamic, interactive information. But, in order to make sure that media enhances rather than detracts from your website, you must strike a balance between these advantages and factors like performance, accessibility, and user experience.

Working with video: 
---------------------------------------
When working with video on the web, there are a number of important factors to take into account in order to make sure that your material is user-friendly, accessible, and runs smoothly on a variety of devices and browsers.

Important aspects of working with video content:
----------------------------------------------------------
•	Video hosting: 
-----------------------------------------------------------
Self-hosting vs. third party hosting: Choose whether to utilize a third-party service like Vimeo, YouTube, or AWS, or to host films on your own server. While third-party services make managing compatibility and bandwidth easier, they may also restrict your ability to customize the look and feel of the video player.

•	File formats and compression
-----------------------------------------------------------
Formats: are used widely to support video elements like MP4 to ensure compatibility across browsers and devices.
Compression: compress videos to reduce file sizes without significantly impacting quality.

•	Responsive design:
------------------------------------------------------------
Media queries: To load various video sizes or quality depending on the screen size and resolution of the device, use media queries.

Working with captions and subtitles:
------------------------------------------------------------
Making video content readable and interesting for a wide range of viewers requires careful handling of captions and subtitles. Subtitles translate the dialogue into another language, whereas captions are text copies of spoken words in videos. For viewers who are hard of hearing or deaf, for viewers who speak other languages, or even for viewers in sound-sensitive surroundings, both are essential. 

Embedding media via iframes:
-------------------------------------------------------------
An HTML element called an iframe (Inline Frame) makes it possible to embed an external webpage inside of another HTML document.
Key aspects: 
-------------------------------------------------------------
•	Basics of iframes: the basic syntax for an iframe involves the <iframe> tag with attributes like src, width, height, frameborder, and allow Fullscreen. 
•	Security and privacy: Content security policy: Control the sources from which iframes load content by using CSP headers. This will shield your website from clickjacking attacks and other security flaws.
